**Figure No.1. Source: [SoK: Blockchain Decentralization](https://github.com/SciEcon/SoK_Blockchain_Decentralization/), created by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)**

Figure No.1 represents the dencity of AAVE, COMP, and LUSD's decentralizaton index under 30-day simple moving average. The y-axis shows the 30-day moving average of the decentralization index of these three tokens. The legend shows that the fatter the violin is, the more centralized the data will be. In the boxplot inside the violin, the imaginary line shows the mean value and the full line stands for the median value. We can learn from the figure that under SMA30, AAVE obviously has a higher decentralization index and a larger range than the other two tokens, while the index of LUSD seems to be the most centralized and lower that the other two tokens.
